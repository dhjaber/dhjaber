I've always been passionate about Information Technology and Computers. 
I've graduated with (bachelor degree) in Computer Science from Sanaa University (Yemen) 
to pursue my dream of being an IT expert.
  I was associated with Boudl Hotels and Resorts (SaudiArabia) as an IT Support Technical Support Engineer.
So I'm seeking education abroad to extend my experience and knowledge base.
